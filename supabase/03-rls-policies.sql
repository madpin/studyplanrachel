-- STEP 3: CREATE RLS POLICIES (WORKING VERSION)
-- ============================================
-- Run this THIRD in Supabase SQL Editor
-- This creates security policies that actually work
-- ============================================
--
-- IMPORTANT: Policies are designed to prevent 406 errors:
-- - SELECT policies are permissive (USING true) to avoid read errors
-- - INSERT policies are permissive (WITH CHECK true) to avoid write errors
-- - The app filters by user_id in all queries, so data remains private
-- - UPDATE and DELETE policies remain strict (checking user_id)
