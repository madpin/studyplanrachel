## 🔄 How It Works

### First-Time User Experience

1. **User signs up** → Account created in Supabase Auth
2. **App checks for user data** → Finds no existing data
3. **Auto-initialization** → Loads default modules and settings
4. **User sees dashboard** → Pre-populated with 12 study modules
5. **Ready to customize** → User can edit everything

### Returning User Experience

1. **User logs in** → Session restored
2. **App loads user data** → Fetches from Supabase
3. **Dashboard updates** → Shows progress, tasks, notes
4. **Real-time sync** → Changes save automatically

### Data Flow

```
User Action → JavaScript (app.js) → Supabase API → PostgreSQL Database
                                                          ↓
User Interface ← JavaScript Updates ← Supabase Response ←┘
```

## 🔒 Security Features

✅ **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Users can only access their own data
✅ **Secure Authentication** - Handled by Supabase Auth
✅ **HTTPS Encryption** - All data encrypted in transit
✅ **Environment Variables** - API keys not hardcoded
✅ **Input Validation** - SQL injection protection
✅ **Session Management** - Automatic token refresh

## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### Automatic Progress Calculation

When a user marks a task as complete:
1. `toggleTaskCompletion()` updates the task in the database
2. `updateModuleProgress()` recalculates module completion
3. Module completion is based on matching task names to subtopics
4. Progress bars update automatically

### First-Time User Initialization

New users get:
- 12 default study modules (Anatomy, Genetics, etc.)
- Pre-configured exam date (customizable)
- Empty daily schedules (ready for tasks)
- Sample motivational messages

All data is loaded from the `defaultModules` array in `app.js` and inserted into Supabase.

### Real-Time Data Sync

- All changes save to Supabase immediately
- Notes have a 1-second debounce (avoids excessive saves)
- Task completions update instantly
- Settings changes persist immediately

### Customization

Users can edit:
- ✏️ Exam dates
- ✏️ Trip dates (for planning breaks)
- ✏️ Daily notes
- ✏️ Task completion status
- ✏️ Module progress (automatic)

Future enhancements can add:
- Module creation/editing
- Task creation/editing
- Custom daily schedules
- And more!

## 📊 Database Schema

### Tables

1. **user_settings** - Exam dates, trip dates
2. **modules** - Study modules with progress
3. **daily_schedule** - Day-by-day schedule data
4. **task_categories** - Task groupings
5. **tasks** - Individual tasks with completion status
6. **daily_notes** - User notes per day
7. **sba_tests** - SBA test tracking
8. **sba_schedule** - SBA test schedule
9. **revision_resources** - Week-based revision materials
10. **catch_up_queue** - Rescheduled tasks

All tables have:
- `user_id` foreign key to `auth.users`
- Row Level Security policies
- Automatic timestamps
- Proper indexes for performance

## 🐛 Known Limitations

Current version limitations (can be enhanced):

1. **Tasks are pre-generated** - No UI to create custom tasks yet
2. **Modules are pre-loaded** - Can't add new modules from UI yet
3. **Daily schedule is basic** - No complex scheduling logic yet
4. **No task dependencies** - Tasks are independent
5. **No data export** - Can't export to external formats yet

These are easy to add as enhancements!

## 📝 Development Notes

### Code Organization

- **`auth.js`** - All authentication logic, session management
- **`app.js`** - Main application state, data loading, UI rendering
- **`config.js`** - Supabase configuration (API keys)
- **`style.css`** - Complete styling with design system tokens

### Design System

The app uses a comprehensive design system with:
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Consistent spacing scale
- Semantic color tokens
- Responsive breakpoints
- Reusable component styles

### State Management

Application state is stored in the `appState` object:
```javascript
{
  userSettings: {},    // User preferences
  modules: [],         // Study modules
  tasks: {},           // Tasks by date
  dailyNotes: {},      // Notes by date
  catchUpQueue: [],    // Rescheduled tasks
  viewingDate: Date,   // Current viewing date
  ...
}
```
