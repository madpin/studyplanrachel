# Daily View Updates - SBA and Telegram Integration

## Overview

The Daily View has been enhanced to show SBA tests and Telegram questions alongside regular tasks, making it a complete overview of everything scheduled for each day.

## What's New in Daily View

### 1. Unified Daily Overview

The Daily View now displays three types of items:

1. **ðŸ“š Regular Tasks** - Your study tasks organized by category
2. **ðŸ“‹ SBA Tests** - All SBA tests scheduled for the day
3. **ðŸ’¬ Telegram Questions** - All telegram questions for the day

### 2. Visual Organization

Each type appears in its own collapsible section:
- Click the arrow (â–¶) to expand/collapse any section
- Each section shows the count of items
- Placeholder items are clearly marked with badges and styling

### 3. Full Edit Capabilities

**For SBA Tests:**
- âœ… Check/uncheck to mark completed
- âœ… Click "Edit" to change the test name
- âœ… Click "Delete" to remove the entry

**For Telegram Questions:**
- âœ… Check/uncheck to mark completed
- âœ… Click "Edit" to open full edit modal
- âœ… Click "Delete" to remove the question

**For Regular Tasks:**
- âœ… Check/uncheck to mark completed
- âœ… Placeholder tasks are visually distinct

### 4. Placeholder Visibility

Placeholders created via the placeholder calendar now appear in the Daily View:
- **Dashed border** around placeholder items
- **Warning background color** (light yellow/orange)
- **"Placeholder" badge** clearly labeled
- Easy to identify and delete if plans change

## Usage Examples

### Typical Daily View Workflow

1. **Morning Review:**
   - Open Daily View
   - See all tasks, SBA tests, and Telegram questions for today
   - Prioritize based on time estimates and work day suitability

2. **During Study:**
   - Check off items as you complete them
   - Edit placeholders with actual content when ready
   - Delete placeholders if you skip them

3. **Evening Review:**
   - Check overall completion status
   - Add notes about the day's study
   - Review tomorrow's schedule using date navigator

### Managing Placeholders

**Scenario:** You created SBA placeholders for next week but now have specific tests:

1. Navigate to the date in Daily View
2. Click "Edit" on the placeholder SBA entry
3. Change "TBD - Placeholder" to "Anatomy SBA Day 1"
4. The placeholder badge remains until you uncheck `is_placeholder` in the database (or delete and create a new proper entry)

**Quick Delete:**
1. See a placeholder you don't need
2. Click "Delete"
3. Confirm deletion
4. Item removed immediately from all views

## Technical Details

### Data Loading

When you view a date in Daily View, the system now loads:
- Task categories and tasks
- SBA schedule entries for that date
- Telegram questions for that date
- Daily notes

All data is cached in `appState` for quick rendering.

### Synchronization

Changes made in Daily View automatically sync with:
- SBA Tests view
- Telegram Q view
- Header statistics
- Module progress (for tasks)

### Performance

- Data is loaded only for the viewed date
- Minimal database queries
- Efficient rendering with collapsible sections

## Key Features

### 1. Context Switching
Edit in Daily View or dedicated views - changes sync everywhere:
```
Daily View â†’ Edit SBA â†’ Syncs to â†’ SBA Tests View
Daily View â†’ Complete Telegram Q â†’ Updates â†’ Header Stats
```

### 2. Placeholder Management
- Create via calendar picker
- View in Daily View
- Edit to add real content
- Delete if not needed

### 3. Visual Hierarchy
```
Daily View
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“š Regular Tasks (Category 1)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Task 1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Task 2 (placeholder)

```

## Best Practices
