# Weekly and Monthly View Updates

## Overview

The Weekly and Monthly (Calendar) views have been enhanced to display the same daily information that appears in the Daily View, including SBA tests and Telegram questions. This provides a complete overview of all scheduled items across all views.

## What's New

### 1. Weekly View Enhancements

The Weekly View now displays detailed information for each day of the week:

- **📚 Tasks**: Shows completion count (e.g., "Tasks: 3/5")
- **📋 SBA Tests**: Shows completed SBA tests count (e.g., "SBA: 1/2")
- **💬 Telegram Questions**: Shows completed questions count (e.g., "Telegram: 2/3")
- **Empty State**: Days without scheduled items show "No items scheduled"

Each day card is clickable and takes you directly to the Daily View for that specific date.

### 2. Monthly/Calendar View Enhancements

The Calendar View now displays indicators on each day that has scheduled items:

- **Visual Indicators**: Days with tasks, SBA tests, or Telegram questions show colored indicators
- **Border Highlight**: Days with items have a teal border and light background
- **Completion Status**: Each indicator shows completed/total count
  - 📚 Tasks completion
  - 📋 SBA tests completion
  - 💬 Telegram questions completion
- **Today Highlight**: Current day maintains its distinctive border
- **Clickable**: Click any day to view full details in Daily View

### 3. Data Loading

Both views now load complete data for all displayed dates:
- Tasks from all task categories
- SBA schedule entries
- Telegram questions
- Completion status for all items

The data is loaded asynchronously when you switch to these views or navigate between weeks/months.

## Visual Design

### Weekly View Cards

Each day card shows:
```
Monday
15 Jan
━━━━━━━━━━━━
📚 Tasks: 3/5
📋 SBA: 1/2
💬 Telegram: 2/3
```

Or for days without items:
```
Tuesday
16 Jan
━━━━━━━━━━━━
No items scheduled
```

### Calendar View Days

Days with items show:
```
┌─────────────┐
│ 15          │
│             │
│ 📚 3/5      │
│ 📋 1/2      │
│ 💬 2/3      │
└─────────────┘
```

Days without items show only the date number.

## Technical Changes
